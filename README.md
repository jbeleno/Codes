# Data Processing and Augmentation Project

This repository contains Python scripts for data processing, augmentation, and splitting, useful for computer vision and machine learning tasks.

## Project Structure

### 1. Folder: `Data Augmentation`

Contains scripts to perform different image augmentation techniques:

- **Rotate.py**  
  Performs rotations on images to increase the variety of training data.

- **Flipping.py**  
  Applies horizontal and/or vertical flips to images.

- **Perspective.py**  
  Applies perspective transformations to simulate different viewing angles.

### 2. Folder: `Model Testing`

- **Test.py**  
  Script dedicated to testing and validating the functions implemented in the augmentation and data processing modules.

### 3. Folder: `Data Splitting`

- **splitting.py**  
  Script to split datasets into training, validation, and test subsets, facilitating model organization and evaluation.
